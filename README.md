# Matrix-decompostion-and-its-applications

In this project, we've provided explanations of various matrix decomposition methods and showcased their practical applications in fields like signal processing and machine learning in recommender systems. The implementations and analyses conducted by each team member collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding of matrix decomposition and its real-world significance.

# Project Overview

Matrix decomposition, also known as matrix factorization, involves breaking down a matrix into simpler and more manageable components. This project explores the implementation and application of several matrix decomposition techniques:

- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Eigenvalue Decomposition
- LU Decomposition
- QR Decomposition
  
### Applications

**Signal Processing using PCA**
PCA (Principal Component Analysis) in digital signal processing efficiently breaks down signals into uncorrelated components, aiding noise reduction and dimensionality reduction.

**Recommender Systems using SVD**
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is employed in recommender systems to predict user preferences and generate personalized recommendations.
